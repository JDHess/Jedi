          <h2 class="card-title">Assignment 1: Jedi Basics</h2>
          <p class="card-text">There are no right or wrong answers to the following. It is just a way to find out what you think and where you might be as a Jedi student.

            Please post your answers in your introduction topic.

            Assignment 1: Jedi Basics 
            <br>
            <br>
            1. What do you think it means to follow the Jedi Way?</p>
            <strong><p>Trying to live by these principles: Forgiveness of yourself and others, Compassion, Attempting Emotional Control, Learning to gain knowledge on life and other perspectives, Trying to think before you act, faith in something greater than yourself, and humility. </p></strong>
            <br>
            <p>2. In your own words define the Force. What is it? How did it originate? How does it work?</p>
            <strong><p>There are four elemental forces that make up our Universe according to science, these forces all originated as one Force or Unified Force. The growth of this Force was used to create everything in our Universe. God created this Force. People throughout history have been watching this Force, and using the knowledge they gained to describe  the natural laws and wisdoms of the Universe. Their continuous on reaching for answers have lead them to find truths on morality, science, and math -all searching for the meanings of some aspect of existence. Some of these truths are words to describe God weather intentional or not, and through the Force, we can see a reflection of who God is. Connecting with the Force is natural, and our ongoing reachings point towards to God but many are against Him anyways and don't give Him credit for such things. </p></strong>

          <h4 class="card-title">Assignment 2: Service</h4>
          <p class="card-text">One test to find out whether you have what it takes to become a Jedi Knight relates to your attitude toward service.
<br>
<br>
            You should start by doing at least one thing to help out around your home everyday, without being asked.
            <br><br>
            Then you should begin to look for people in your neighborhood, church, town, etc... that you can help. Mow lawns, weed flowerbeds, clean out garages, even changing light bulbs can be a big help for some people.
            <br><br>
            Finally, get in the habit of helping out wherever you can, and try to help people without them knowing about it. Let them be surprised.
            <br><br>
            For this assignment write telling about the kind of things you have done and how you felt after you had done them.</p>
            <strong><p>
                I did some things for my mom like unloading the dishwasher, doing laundry, and plucking weeds. Also when I was working for my mom this week, I did things before I was asked to, and tried to go the extra mile when completing a task. I also decided to start doing unexpected kind things for others and I've been seeing smiles on everyone's faces after their surprise. It feels nice helping others, but that's not the reason why I've been doing these things. It may have started about because of the Jedi initiate training, but I've also done some of these things before I started on that journey. Despite it feeling good, deep down it's for helping others. It's for them, rather what ever joy I might get out of it after the work is done. Yes it feels fulfilling, but I feel that it's more to it than that. </p></strong>

          <h2 class="card-title">Assignment 3: Self Discipline</h2>
          <p class="card-text">In order to help the others, we need to make ourselves able to do it.
            Let's consider what was given to us: our body, our mind, our energy, the Force.
            Then we were born in the lucky part of the world, where we can access teachings, we can train, these are huge gifts and it is our responsibility, to take care of them, to make them grow and to use them to support who is weaker. We need to be strong for who is weak.
            <br><br>
            Proverbs 25:28
            "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls."
            <br><br>
            1 Corinthians 9:24-27
            "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified"
            <br><br>
            
            The only way to live this responsibility daily is self discipline.
            Consider your body, find ways to keep it healthy and more in shape, in your way of living, eating, in your habits of life. Find the best physical activity for you and commit to train each day.
            <br><br>
            Now body and mind are one:
            <br>
            Quiet the mind to relax the body<br>
            Relax the body to quiet the mind.<br>
            This is the key to balance.<br>
            Observe your mind, take time for yourself, meditate (we’ll post a vast choice of techniques)
            <br><br>
            Now many of you will struggle to find time to train this way. Keep in mind that you can use anything to train: walk or run instead of taking the bus to go to school or at work, practice perpetual meditation (being mindful of each second of your life), be open to learn from anyone or any event.
            The more you’ll train , the more benefit you’ll have and the more you’ll enjoy training!
            <br><br>
            This simple exercise will help you realize how precious is your life, and how many great gifts you received:
            Each week, write a thank letter to life. (It can be made mentally too)
            <br><br>Start with Dear Life,…<br>
            And thank life for 5 things/events/persons that happened to you during last week.
            <br><br>
            Be as constant as you can with every lesson and assignment, Jedi training never ends and results can take time to be seen. There may be days when you have no will to train, in these moments, strengthen your will power and win your laziness, it is a greater victory obtained each day!
            <br><br>
            And we are here for you talk whenever you want!
            </p>
            <strong><p>Dear life, <br>
                Thank you for showing me that with meditation I can handle the events you throw at me. It's hard sometimes but I know if I take breaks and work through my feelings slowly I can maintain better emotional control. </p></strong>
            <strong><p>Dear life, <br>
                Thank you for the experiences I've had with meeting more knowledgeable Jedi online recently, their advice is often as valuable as gold and often helps me rest with a sound mind. 
                </p></strong>
            <strong><p>Dear life, <br>
                Thank you for the small moments you give me, time with nature or just in quiet. It's a small bit of peace I can carry with me in a hectic life. 
                </p></strong>
            <strong><p>Dear life, <br>
                Thank you for those who have been kind to me, their compassion shows goodness in this world and their assurance is encouraging. </p></strong>
            <strong><p>Dear life, <br>
                Thank you for challenges and adversities. Even though I don't like them at all, they always help me learn something new and many of them end up helping me in my future. </p></strong>

            Post your experience and sensations.</p>
            <strong><p>Like a non judgmental observer, focusing on my breath and just watching thoughts drift by. Detaching from thoughts is peaceful. I've actually practiced this meditation before, and find that this sense of calm helps me with emotional control. It brings all the thoughts in the background to light and helps with understanding ourselves better and look at our emotions and thoughts in a non-judgmental way. I don't find it too incredibly difficult to detach and just observe my thoughts but once and a while there's a thought I begin to interact with. When this happens during this kind of meditation I'll often focus on my breath to recenter myself. I've been meditating with Contemplative Christian groups for a few years now. Sitting for a long time in meditation isn't difficult for me that much anymore and I find I need to meditate a few times a day in some way or form to have a calm mind and not be overwhelmed by life. With my previous experience in meditation, I've noticed certain Christian groups use this kind of meditation as a quiet connection with God -a way of saying, "Here I am Lord" and asking Him to abide with them in the present moment. </p></strong>
            <strong><p>Honestly the churches in my area kinda look down on meditation too but some do other mindfulness practices like yoga that they use for outreach. I’ve been meditating online on free meditation zoom group platform that does a lot of Christian meditation groups. I also like to go to the Taoist meditation group which is frequented by a lot of Christians and I feel they have a lot of insight about the Force even though they refer to it as the Tao.</p></strong>

          <h2 class="card-title">Assignment 5: The Force </h2>
          <p class="card-text">As Christian Jedi, we know that God created the Force and that our relationship with the Force is closely linked with our relationship with God.
<br><br>
            The Force is a gift from God so starting from here is a good thing.
            Before learning about the Force, it is important to respect it, because this shows also our respect for God.
            I don't think a Christian Jedi can fully know the Force if he doesn't strive to know God always better.
            The Force is a strong link with God, but it is also true that God allows us to feel the Force and to understand it.
            <br><br>
            Master Yoda taught to Luke the importance of Faith, so this is the first step to take in order to study the Force.
            <br><br>
            
            Practices:
            <br><br>
            -Jedi Breathing:
            <br>
            When we breath in, we breath oxygen and energy (Living Force), it happens naturally but being aware of it, can make it more powerful.
            Breath in, thinking you are at the center of the universe, surrounded with the Force, the energy of God, you breath in it, it goes through your nose down your lungs until your Tan-Tien.
            Breath out, the Force expands in all your body and out of it, all the energy you do not need goes out of you and joins the universal energy (Unifying Force).
            With each breath, you can feel a sense of strength, love and gratitude for the great gift God made you.
            <br><br>
            -Meditation:
            <br>
            Meditate on these concepts:
            How do you feel the link between God and the Force?
            How is it present in your daily life?
            Do you have difficulties in building a relationship with the Force? And with God?
            <br><br>
            Go to The Force page and practice "Feeling the Force" and "Making the Force Flow."
            The more you practice the stronger you will become in the Force. Post about your experience in your introduction topic.
            </p>
            <strong><p>The Force is energy that exists through out the universe that I believe God uses as a link and insight into who He is. When understanding the nature of what we call the Force, wise people of ancient societies seemed to see the characteristics of God; Compassion, Helping Others, Humbleness, Patience, Kindness, Gentleness, Self Control... God is ever present in daily life weather we're aware of it or not. As a Christian, I know that God is always with me, and it's a personal presence. God personally breathed life into Atom, I feel that that act symbolizes God's personal care in having a relationship with us. I find that leaning on God makes my life a lot filled with less worry because I have faith in Him. I often meditate to draw closer to God, sometimes reading short scriptures from the Psalms to meditate on. For me when I meditate on the Force, it's seeing God through the eyes of creation. I see Him in what He's made, and there's a personal presence that's with me. It seems to me that being in nature is a good place to connect with God, and meditating from Biblical scriptures are a good way to start a conversation with Him because He speaks to us through His Word. Clearing the mind and just sitting in God's presence is peaceful at times, and I feel gratitude and compassion for God and His creation when in nature, when meditating on the Force, and when meditating with God.  I've found that meditation has helped me grow closer in my relationship with God, and reading His Word allows me to learn more about Him. Honestly building a relationship with the Lord has not always been this way. When I was younger, I rarely ever thought of God besides in church, but after getting really sick in high school, I grew closer to God but at the time I was growing very weak because of the illness and God gave me the strength to get better when I was too weak to even stand on my own. I honestly believe that God saved my life, and I saw how wonderful the Lord really is, which drove me to want to learn more about Him and drew me closer to Him. He gives me peace and He is present in every moment.

          <h2 class="card-title">Assignment 6: Physical Fitness</h2>
          <p class="card-text">A real Jedi need to keep a fit body in order to be healthy and able to help.
            <br>
            More will be taught about fitness, nutrition, sports, eventually Martial Arts.
            <br>
            As a first approach, consider your physical body, how is it?
            <br>
            Look at your physical activity? Are you practricing sport? Are you feeling well in your body?
            Whatever you find, do not be discouraged, you can change things, and training will help.
            <br><br>
            As a first exercise, practice the Horse Stance:
            <br><br>
            Horse Stance - the horse stance is the beginning position for many exercises. It strengthens your legs and helps you develop a solid base so that it is difficult for someone to knock you off your feet.
            <br><br>
            To do Horse Stance stand so your feet are more than shoulder width apart. Stand straight, hands hanging naturally at your sides, bend your knees, tuck your buttocks slightly and tuck your chin slightly. You should feel like a marionette suspended from a string attached at the crown of your head, able to bounce gently from the knees.
            <br><br>
            Holding horse stance is an excellent way to strengthen your legs, not just for martial arts but any sport that requires leg strength - football, soccer, basketball, etc.
            <br><br>
            It is said that a youth wanting to be accepted in the Shaolin Temple had to be able to hold horse stance for 1 hour. Starting out most people should be able to hold it for at least 1 minute. If you practice every day you should be up to 5 minutes within a month.
            <br><br>
            When I practice I also do abdominal (deep) breathing at the same time. 5 slow counts as I inhale, 5 slow counts as I exhale. This helps take my mind off the pain in my legs.
            <br><br>
            It may seem like a silly thing to do, but as a beginner there is a real sense of accomplishment the first time you are able to hold horse stance for 5 minutes.
            (by Master Kai Stormwalker)
            <br><br>
            Try to aim at holding this stance for at least 5 min, do it a little each day. Also look at your habits and try to move more, walk, run...</p>
            <strong><p>I'm apart of 2 Tai Chi groups, and for the one we do in the morning we hold horse stance for a while before we start while slowly adjusting. I like going to the Tai Chi groups, one of them is a Christian group and we follow it with a meditation. I also lift 5lb sandbags in each hand and carry them across grass or up and down stairs for work and practice various martial arts styles. I practice Baguazhang Kung Fu which is mostly an open palm Kung Fu style which I prefer because there's less risk of injury (there's less bones to break in the palm than in the fist). I also do single Kung Fu Fan and Tai Chi Fan but I want to move up to double fan soon. I practice sword fighting techniques and Filipino Stick Fighting techniques with the hand fans as well. I'll often practice knife fighting techniques with a pair of chopsticks, and will often carry chopsticks around with me just in case of needing them, but I mostly just use them when I'm trying to eat something and don't have a fork available. Honestly I think there's room for improvement in healthy habits such as physical exercise, but I'm working on it almost every day.  Overall I like to practice Martial Arts, I feel good afterwards and I get excess energy out. </p></strong>

          <p class="card-text">Read this and write a paragraph telling why practicing good manners is important.
<br><br>
            Post your response in your Introduction topic.

            GOOD MANNERS:
            <br><br>
            
            What are Good Manners?
            <br><br>
            Every culture has evolved with slightly different interpretations of good manners but the basic principles are the same. Good manners are a significant part of who you are. They are about civility, mutual respect and shared values. A society without these three is not a society at all but a civil war zone. Modern manners are about how we live our lives in society today. Included in this are the shared ethics and a moral code which evolves from our shared values of:
            <br><br>
            common decency<br>
            social & cultural respect<br>
            hard work<br>
            kindness, compassion & charity<br>
            courtesy & politeness<br>
            <br><br>
            Put together these represent a genuine care and concern for others, where privacy is respected, power is not abused and forgiveness is key. The following can be applied to just about every occasion, just about every time. There will always be rare exceptions. It is not easy to get them all right all of the time at first. Start by taking the rules one or two at a time and make them your normal practice.
            <br>
            1. Greetings: Shake hands firmly. Use full names and titles unless invited to use first names. Introduce strangers to each other.
            <br>
            2. Good Hygiene. Bathe/shower daily. Keep your hair clean. At puberty you should start to use and antipersperent/deoderant. Cover your mouth with your elbow when coughing; don’t pick nose, ears, hands, nails or anywhere else. No fidgeting, scratching and readjusting clothing. Gum chewing should be done in private.
            <br>
            3. Timekeeping. Puncuality demonstrates both respect and self-control. Arrive on time, be interested in what is going on and stay to a natural conclusion. There is no excuse for getting this one wrong without being RUDE barring a major personal disaster.
            <br>
            4. Be Discreet. Balance appropriate interest with apparent nosiness. Do not get involved in gossip and speculation about what you might see, hear, say or do. Unless the individual brings it to you you should regard it as private and certainly not a topic of conversation.
            <br>
            5. Body Language. A significant part of the communication process. Be careful to give out the right messages. Good manners dictate that you should sit up straight with your feet on the floor with a ready smile and general good humor. Gentlemen sit with their legs together.
            <br>
            6. Personal space. Judge it well. The amount depends on the circumstances but do not violate other people’s personal space. As a general rule leave 12-15 inches of space between you and another person at a social gathering and more at a less intimate event. Watch the person you are speaking to, if they move back, it will be their instinct suggesting you are too close and you should stand back a little.
            <br>
            7. Money. Pay your share of a group bill. At social occasions it would be rude to work out and pay only your own individual costs. The highest spenders might want to leave the tip, that would display real good modern manners. If you are a guest at a function/event then you must reciprocate at a suitable point. It does not have to be dollar for dollar. Do something within your means. You must thank the host/ess of a private function.
            <br>
            8. Gifts. Receive with grace and give with thought. If you are given a gift, accept it with grace, take a moment to look at it and admire it. If you give a gift, be thoughtful. A good idea is to give something that you would like to receive yourself. Gifts do not have to be expensive, indeed the gift must not embarrass the recipient by its generosity. The thought really does mean more than the cost.
            <br>
            9. Basic Good Table Manners. These are so important. Eat and drink quietly. Elbows in and off the table. Pace your eating. Converse with all the other guests, but not with your mouth full, compliment the cook, thank the hostess. Good table manners show you care about yourself and other people around you because you take the trouble not to offend. Table manners are also based on the best, most sensible way to do things. Table manners show you have self-discipline and a respect of community. Making a mistake at the table is just that, a mistake, it is not the end of the world and a good host will not even notice. But be aware of what is going on around you. If you are the only person who is dunking their roll in their soup it would be a good idea to discreetly stop.
            <br>
            10. Lipstick & Perfume. Be careful not to leave lipstick on cups and glasses. Discreetly wipe it away with a napkin or paper tissue if you do. When food or drink is involved in a gathering you should wear only gentle perfumes. Also, remember that many people are allergic to perfumes so yours should never be overpowering.
            <br>
            11. Dress Codes. Remember, it is always better to be overdressed than underdressed.
            <br>
            12. Borrowing. ‘Neither a borrower or lender be.’ If you do borrow anything it should be returned as soon as possible and in the same or better condition as you received it.
            <br>
            13. Fun & Games. Have fun and enjoy yourself at social gatherings but follow local customs and traditions. It is better to follow any legitimate local rules than to get into arguments. Always be polite and respectful of others.
            <br>
            14. Please & Thank You. Never leave an event without saying thank you. Always acknowledge an act of kindness. No excuses, just do it. If you are invited in writing a written thank you is essential.
            <br>
            15. Electronic Communications & Games. Be aware of the time and place for these things. At the very least switch them to silent and go easy on the keys. Better still switch them off. If you must take or make a call go outside or to another room. Games should never be played when there are other people present.
            <br>
            16. Respect for Others. Open doors for other people, whatever sex, and let them through ahead of you. If someone opens a door for you say ‘Thank you.’ Women open doors for men these days, it’s not about gender it’s about consideration. Give up your seat for someone who looks in need of it, whatever sex. Receive such kindnesses with grace and charm and say, ‘Thank you.’ You might be secretly offended that the giver thinks you are more in need of the seat, don’t be, take the seat and be polite. Say, ‘Excuse me’ if you have to interrupt someone from what they are doing. Demonstrate respect for old, young, male, female, everyone at all times.</p>
            <strong><p>Good manners are good to practice, they show self discipline, respect for others, kindness, compassion, and shows that you're caring for others. It shows that you care and it puts others before the self. </p></strong>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="card-title">Assignment 8: The Jedi Code</h2>
          <p class="card-text">This lesson is about understanding the Jedi Codes and making ourselves able to follow them.
            <br><br>The Jedi Code has evolved in time, the first version was:<br>
            (one could consider this the Internal Jedi Code)<br><br>
            There is no emotion, there is peace.<br>
            There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.<br>
            There is no passion, there is serenity.<br>
            There is no chaos, there is harmony.<br>
            There is no death, there is the Force.<br>
            <br><br>
            The first line means that a Jedi should be able to deal with his emotions in order to find inner peace.
            <br>The second line is about the importance of knowledge, self knowledge and knowledge of the external world. In the Buddhist tradition ignorance is considered as the root of any other flaw.
            <br>The third line means that a Jedi should be able to channel his passion in the right way, in order to remain serene.
            <br>The fourth line means that a Jedi should be able to find harmony inside of chaos, inside and outside of himself.
            <br>The final line means that death is not the end, it is only the beginning of an eternal journey in the Force.
            <br><br>
            The key to this Code is not in analyzing the words but simply in feeling their energy.
            <br><br>
            With time, the Code became:<br>
            (one may consider this the External or Social Jedi Code which is also known as the Jedi Creed)
            <br><br>
            Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.
            <br>Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.
            <br>Jedi respect all life, in any form.
            <br>Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.
            <br>Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.
            <br><br>
            This Code deals with the social role of the Jedi. It is complementary to the first Code as the "There is no emotion" Code deals with inner work, while this Code deals with external duties.
            <br><br>
            It is indeed essential to have inner peace in order to preserve peace in our daily life, at home, school, work, neighbourhood...
            <br>A Jedi needs to have also the knowledge and self control required in order to defend himself and the others without aggressivity.
            <br>A Jedi needs serenity in order to respect every form of life, in every possible ways.
            <br>A Jedi needs inner harmony and harmony with the universe in order to serve the others well.
            <br>The ultimate goal of the Jedi is enlightenment for himself and others that is why he needs to study and learn much.
            <br><br>
            As you can see both Codes are intertwined and useful.
            <br><br>
            Now both in the movies and in real life, we can see how difficult it can be to follow these Codes in certain situations...
            <br><br>
            As an assignment, please take time to meditate and reply to the following questions:
            <br><br>Define the word Peace.
            -Observe yourself in a neutral way: Are you at peace? If you are, how will you preserve this peace? How will you spread it around you? If you lack inner peace, how will you obtain it?
            Relate a few situations when you preserved peace in your daily life. 
            <br><br>
            Define Knowledge
            -How do you relate to knowledge? Do you know yourself? Your body? Mind? Emotions? What do you know of the external world? The place you live in? People near you?
            <br><br>
            Define Aggressive.
            Are you an aggressive person? Are you usually the one who attacks first or the one who only defends himself or the others? How could you better your defensive skills?
            <br><br>
            Define passion.
            -Do you have many passions? How do you handle them? Are they harmful or helpful to you? Are you serene?
            <br><br>
            Define respect.
            Do you respect any form of life? What is your relationship with other persons? Foreigners? People who are seen as different? Plants? Animals? Your planet?
            <br><br>
            -How would you define chaos?
            Define harmony.
            Are you feeling harmony in yourself? Harmony with the universe?
            Do you see yourself as a person who needs to dominate? Or as a person who is willing to serve in any situation? How could you improve your skills in serving others?
            <br><br>
            Define discipline.
            -Do you have enough self discipline to train each day? If not, how will you improve it? Do you like to learn new things?
            What is death for you? What is the Force for you?
            <br><br>

            <strong><p>Peace
                <br>I once heard a SwitchFoot song saying, "Inner peace is hard to find, peace of heart and peace of mind. Seems like I'm wrestling all the time -like I'm at war in side. I've been fighting all my life." This I believe could be one of the most sought after things in life -inner peace. I once was told I could find peace by joining a program where I would pay $200 to find it. They made it sound like they were helping people and gaining nothing from their good deeds, saying that I would really benefit from the program. In the end I felt like they were just trying to sell me something, and being pushy about it. To be honest I felt less at peace after talking to them, so I never looked back. I feel that inner peace isn't something you just buy, and that that in fact is the core of the problem. The idea that we need more to be happy is ultimately flawed thinking. Being at peace is being content with life, where you're at, what you have, and how you feel about yourself and others. I feel most at peace when I'm content. Meditation is a good idea to help prevent inner turmoil and calm strong emotions that might keep you up at night. Working through situations may help you feel content with them. All seem to be aims to resolve the inner wars within us with diplomacy and kindness. I believe that this is the beginning of inner peace. This is something I try to work on constantly. I'm not perfect at it, but it is a skill I still try to perfect.  

            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Knowledge
                <br>It seems often it's easier for me to understand the emotions of people around me than my own. Expressing them in words becomes even harder. My mind is a place of constant questioning, mostly for the seeking of truth and seeing past deceptions. I don't wish to fall into the trap of deception, so I'm careful not to trust in what I think I perceive too easily. This doesn't mean I lack faith in what can't be seen, just that I'm wary of manipulation. Perhaps this is because of my past, when I was younger I fell into the paths of manipulative people who where guided by selfishness, and talked to me with insincere smiles. Sometimes this makes it difficult to trust, and the world begins to feel like a dangerous place. Yes there is good in it and I try not to judge others for it, even when they've wronged me. We all have battle scars and we have to keep moving forward with the flow of time. It just changes your perspective of the world, and your perspective can change how you see reality.
            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Agressive
                <br>I'm not a very aggressive person, but I've grown up with people who have anger issues and don't realize their problem. I'm not usually the first one to start an argument, but I tend get defensive sometimes and loose my emotional control in high stress environments often resulting in a panic attack but I've been getting better. I've been working on being calm in stressful situations, and learning deescalation techniques to improve. 
            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Passion
                <br>I have a strong passion for justice, fairness, and forgiveness. I believe in equality, and try to treat others with respect. I don't get offended easily, but often I get emotionally hurt when others aren't treated fairly, or if I feel like I've been wronged. I try to look at things from multiple perspectives, and stand up for others. Though this passion also drives me to defensiveness, but it's something I'm trying to learn how to prevent so I can think clearly in stressful situations. I try not to get into the obsessions of my past. Little things, passions... thinking I needed something to find happiness and fulfillment. They all just lead to more unrest. Turning towards God and living in more simplicity left me with far more happiness then always driving towards something or somewhere else. Having ambition in life may seem like a good thing in life, but it seems in my life it has often lead me to places other than the life I'm living now. Always wanting and seeking for more in life is draining on my very being, and I just don't want that anymore. I just want to live in contentment. I watched a video today that said that a man who was already happy was given advice on becoming a millionaire, he asked, "Why would I want to do that?" the reply was simply, "To move away, build a company, work, and make money so you can retire and do the exact same things you're doing to be happy right now."
            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Respect
                <br>I believe that all forms of life should be respected. I try to respect everyone, even when they disrespect me. When I meet people from other places, I take the time to learn about them and their culture. The differences people have can be a way of saying that we all have different strengths, and getting to know each other leads to greater knowledge and understanding.  
            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Chaos
                <br>Chaos is a hectic life. Harmony is peacefulness, calmness, and purpose. I feel that I have harmony within my self and I try to maintain even when life can be hectic. The Universe is in Harmony because God has a plan or purpose at work within it. Though it may seem disorderly some times, it doesn't mean that it isn't without purpose. I don't feel like I'm a person that needs to be in charge all the time, honestly that sounds stressful, not very peaceful and quite hectic. I'll let others be in charge and help where I can. I hope that by seeing other people's needs more clearly I'll be able to better help them. 
            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>Discipline
                <br>I try to work at something every day. Sometimes I get tired and feel like a rest so I often take that time to meditate when it's in the middle of the day. In that way I'm always gaining some kind of insight and find new ways to grow. Learning is not just in books, and if you don't practice you probably will never learn to do something by heart. I guess you can say I have a love for learning. 
            </p></strong>
            
            <strong><p>
                Death is the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. Everyone dies, and everyone lives on after death, and for some it's described as rest and peace with God. Some fall away from God though, and refuse His help... living life without God, in my experience was a life of not truly  living. Through faith I'm saved. Jesus saves people through forgiveness and rescues them from the punishment of eternal death -giving them eternal life. 

            </p></strong>

            <strong><p>
                By looking at nature I see God, from this perspective... nature is made up of the Force. The Force flows through everything, and is from God. It is at it's core a way we see God through His creation. I try to take time every day to sit with God in nature to meditate. I meditate on God's Force, and I draw closer to Him because in essence the Force is what I look through to see God.

            Why Memorize Scripture?
            <br><br>
            As Christian Jedi here is a quote to consider.
            <br><br>
            "For the first time, Obi-wan had his doubts that he could defeat the Prince at his own game.
            Doubt in battle, there cannot be.<br><br>
            Always, in times of trouble, Yoda's teachings rose in his mind."
            <br><br>
            - Jedi Appentice, Mark of the Crown, by Jude Watson
            <br><br>
            Like the teachings of Yoda, the teachings of our Lord should come to our minds whenever they are needed. This is the main reason to memorize scripture. It isn't just something to torment you with.
            
            <br><br>
            
            “I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.”
            - Psalm 119:16
            <br><br>
            Why should Christians memorize God’s Word? To know God’s Will, to live God’s way, to share God’s truth, to worship God, and to receive God’s blessing.
            <br><br>
            
            
            To Know God’s Will: to resist temptation
            <br><br>
            “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”
            - Psalm 119:11
            <br><br>
            We read the Bible to learn about God and the relationship he desires to have with us. God reveals himself to us through his word. He also reveals his will for our lives; what he wants us to do; how we should live.
            <br><br>
            
            
            To Live God’s Way
            <br><br>
            We memorize scripture to internalize the truth of God’s word into our minds and heart, and that God’s will for our lives may be manifested in our living the way that he wants us to.

            To Share God’s Truth
            <br><br>
            “Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”
            - 2 Timothy 2:15
            <br><br>
            But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.”
            - 1 Peter 3:15
            <br><br>
            We memorize scripture so that we can better share the Gospel, the Good News of Christ’s salvation for a lost world; to fulfill the Great Commission.

            To Worship God
            <br><br>
            We memorize scripture, especially Psalms, to use in our prayer time with God. They cover every need in prayer of the human condition, and contain the solutions to the very problems we are praying about.
            To Receive God’s Blessing
            <br><br>
            “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”
            - Hebrews 11:6
            <br><br>
            The greatest blessing that God can give to us is himself; a closer relationship with himself; and the revelation of the knowledge of himself. We receive everything from the Father through Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Hank Hanegraaff says that prayer is not primarily about asking for things, but about developing and growing in communion with, and in a relationship with God. “Prayer is the essence of the Christian life.”

          <p class="card-text">
            I know that a lot of younglings are at an age where they have raging hormones, are dealing with a lot of confusion, and are constantly in conflict with their parents and other authority figures. Here are some scriptures that you should not only memorize, but meditate on in order to help you deal with these issues.
            <br><br>
            The quotes I have used are from The Message, a translation of the Bible in modern language so it is easier to understand.
            <br><br>
            "Watch what God does and then do it, like children who learn proper behavior from their parents. Mostly what God does is love you. Keep company with him and learn a life of love. Observe how Christ loved us. His love was not cautious but extravagant. He didn't love in order to get something from us but to give everything of himself to us. Love like that."
            <br><br>
            Ephesians 5:1-2, The Message
            <br><br>
            "You're familiar with the command to the ancients, 'Do not murder.' I'm telling you that anyone who is so much as angry with a brother or sister is guilty of murder. Carelessly call a brother 'idiot!' and you just might find yourself hauled into court. Thoughtlessly yell 'stupid!' at a sister and you are on the brink of hellfire. The simple moral fact is that words kill."
            <br><br>
            Matthew 5:21-22, The Message
            <br><br>
            "Kill off everything connected with your that old way fo death: sexual promiscuity, impurity, lust, doing whatever you feel like whenever you feel like it, and grabbing whatever attracts your fancy. That's a life shaped by things and feelings instead of by God. It's because of this kind of thing that God is about to explode in anger. It wasn't long ago that you were doing all that stuff and not knowing any better. But you know better now, so make sure it's all gone for good: bad temper, irritability, meanness, profanity, dirty talk."
            <br><br>
            Colossians 3:5-8, The Message
            <br><br>
            <strong>I've been memorizing these scriptures using the following songs: </strong>

            <strong><p>When missionaries brought Christianity to the Native American people, those who left a positive lasting impact on beliefs did not share their beliefs by force, but instead built friendships, led by the way that they lived, and treated these friends with kindness and respect -that’s something to learn from not only for sharing Christianity.</p></strong>
            <strong><p>There were a few missionaries that made friends with the Native American that took up settlement in California. They treated them with respect, but in the end also cheated them with business deals which led to their undoing. The people who forced beliefs onto the Native Americans caused resentment and often the descendents turned back to the beliefs of their ancestors and felt their culture was taken from them. Overall when missionaries where kind and didn’t try to take away Native American beliefs and cultures, the people they impacted stayed with the faith and it created thriving Christian Native American communities.
